# Security Summary - Codex v96 Deployment

## CodeQL Analysis Result

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

- **Python Analysis**: 0 alerts
- **GitHub Actions Analysis**: 0 alerts

No security vulnerabilities detected in the codebase.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- API key authentication (`X-Api-Key` header)
- HMAC request signing (`X-Codex-Sig` header)
- Secure webhook validation with HMAC SHA-256

### 2. Replay Attack Protection
- Nonce-based replay protection in glyph_guard_v18
- Nonce database with automatic cleanup (keeps last 10,000)
- Each nonce hashed with SHA-256 before storage

### 3. Cryptographic Verification
- Threshold signatures using Ed25519
- 2-of-3 quorum verification for sanctify action
- Merkle tree audit trail for tamper detection

### 4. Policy Enforcement
- Deny dangerous emojis and patterns
- Deploy actions require sanctify (quorum verification)
- Maximum steps per execution (default 12)
- Hot-reloadable policy without restart

### 5. Supply Chain Security
- Integrity manifest with SHA-256 hashes
- SBOM generation for dependency tracking
- Vulnerability gate with severity threshold
- SLSA provenance generation
- Transparency log integration (Rekor)

### 6. Audit Trail
- Merkle tree-based audit log
- Cryptographic inclusion proofs
- Tamper-evident history
- Timestamp for all events

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before processing
2. **Secrets Management**: All secrets via environment variables
3. **Least Privilege**: Container runs as non-root user (65532:65532)
4. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
5. **Cryptographic Strength**: SHA-256 and Ed25519 throughout
6. **Secure Defaults**: Development keys marked clearly as "dev-key"

## Threat Model Coverage

| Threat | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Unauthorized Access | API key + HMAC signing | ✅ |
| Replay Attacks | Nonce tracking | ✅ |
| Audit Tampering | Merkle tree | ✅ |
| Malicious Deploy | Quorum verification | ✅ |
| Supply Chain Attack | SBOM + vuln scanning | ✅ |
| Policy Bypass | Glyph guard enforcement | ✅ |
| Injection Attacks | Input validation | ✅ |

## Known Limitations

1. **Nonce Database**: In-memory storage, cleared on restart (acceptable for development)
2. **API Keys**: Single key per environment (could be enhanced with key rotation)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented (should be added for production)

## Recommendations for Production

1. Use secure secret storage (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
2. Implement rate limiting with Redis or similar
3. Add OIDC/JWKS integration for advanced auth
4. Use distributed nonce storage for multi-instance deployments
5. Enable TLS/HTTPS with valid certificates
6. Implement log forwarding to SIEM
7. Add alerting for policy violations
