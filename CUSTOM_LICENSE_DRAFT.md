# Custom Application Terms (Draft)

The codebase is MIT-licensed (see LICENSE.md).

Live features require a valid license receipt verified by your backend or ledger. Receipt verification should be performed server-side; the included Netlify function license-check.js is a placeholder verification stub and must not be used as the only check for gating paid/critical features.

Without a valid receipt, the application must operate in simulated/offline mode and not perform any live actuation.

Branding, data handling, and payment flows must comply with applicable laws. This is a draft for discussion and is not legal advice. Consult a qualified attorney before relying on these terms.
